# roundsystem-legacy
 
Round system that adds stuff like roles, antagonists. 
Handles names and stuff, only thing that isnt in this version is the multi description system. 
This whole code is kinda junk and I've already rescripted a lot of it to be not as big, for example check sv_hooks.lua
My use of timer.simple is a joke and I shouldn't have done it like that, if the new base im going to use is going to require I already have a better method.
